We need you to anonymise this data to hide personal details while preserving any useful information for the data scientists at InsightSpark.

Here are some examples of how you may anonymise a data set:
You could remove columns that donâ€™t provide helpful information for analysis (e.g., names or credit card numbers).
You could mask any columns that can identify an individual (e.g., passport numbers or mobile numbers).
You could categorise personal figures (e.g., age and income) into a bracket rather than a specific number.
