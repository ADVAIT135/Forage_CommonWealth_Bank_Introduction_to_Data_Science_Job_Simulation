Tasks Assigned: - 
Start by familiarising yourself with the “@CommBank Twitter Account” to see what information is publicly available.

When you’re comfortable with the Twitter interface, move forward and begin to look into the Twitter API.
 “Twitter API: Data Dictionary” will show you the types of information that you can scrape from Twitter automatically using a programming language like Python.
“Twitter: Build for Business,” on the other hand, will provide you with insights into how this information can be used in a business environment.

Once you’ve familiarised yourself with the referenced resources, write a proposal that suggests ways that InsightSpark can use the available data on the @CommBank Twitter account
to extract valuable insights.
